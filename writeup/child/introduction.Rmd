## Objective

This research builds upon @klein's methodology by extending the set of joint confidence intervals used to capture uncertainty in overall rankings. In particular, it intends to:

- Construct joint confidence intervals that utilize parametric bootstrap to obtain a tighter overall uncertainty for ranks.
- Establish joint confidence intervals for cases when ranks are assumed to be correlated.
- Evaluate the performance of the proposed approaches under different standard deviations, correlation structures, and dimensionalities.

## Significance

True ranks are estimated based on sample-derived quantities. It follows that uncertainty in the estimators is carried over to the estimated ranking. As a result, a measure of this uncertainty should be reported alongside any resulting overall ranking. This approach accounts not only for the variability of individual estimators but also for the dependence introduced by the relative nature of ranking. It is also essential to consider correlations among ranked objects, which may stem from shared characteristics that predispose groups to occupy nearby ranks.
