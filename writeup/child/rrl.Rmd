## Joint confidence region for an overall ranking

@klein proposed an approach for quantifying overall rank uncertainty following the estimation of respondents' average travel time to work in each $K$ sampled geographical area.

Rank for the $k$th population as 

\begin{equation}
  r_k = \sum^K_{j=1} I(\theta_j \leq \theta_k) = 1 + \sum_{j:j \neq k} I(\theta_j \leq \theta_k), \ \text{for} k = 1, \dots, K
  \label{eq:rank}
\end{equation}

The estimated overall ranking, computed on the basis of the estimates $\hat{\theta}_1, \dots, \hat{\theta}_K$, is denoted by $\left(\hat{r}_1, \dots, \hat{r}_K\right)$, where

\begin{equation}
  r_k = 1 + \sum_{j:j \neq k} I(\hat \theta_j \leq \hat \theta_k), \ \text{for} k = 1, \dots, K
  \label{eq:rank}
\end{equation}

It follows that uncertainty in the estimators $\hat{\theta}_1, \dots, \hat{\theta}_k$ is carried over to the estimated ranking. As a result, a measure of this uncertainty should be reported alongside any resulting overall ranking.
